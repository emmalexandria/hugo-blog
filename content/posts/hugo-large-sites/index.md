Hugo is a great tool. I do freelance programming work for a number of clients, and a large amount of that work has been in Hugo. I love Hugo. I think it's an incredibly clever use of Go's brilliant templating libraries. However, I'm noticing a worrying trend. Hugo is being used more and more by corporate clients who want a full-blown *website*. This is a huge pain in the ass. It makes some sense from a content management perspective, but you're ultimately going to end up paying a team of developers for more hours of work than necessary.
