      <description>Rust is a language which is evangelised primarily for it&amp;rsquo;s safety. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be real here. I like writing safe programs, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care that much. I was never a C or C++ developer. I did follow javid9x&amp;rsquo;s fantastic tutorials when I was younger, but my only real attempt to build something complex in either language was a sudoku solver which never worked because my code for drawing the board kept segfaulting.</description>
