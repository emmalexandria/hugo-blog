I&amp;rsquo;m going to be real here. I like writing safe programs, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care that much. I was never a C or C++ developer. I did follow &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9">javid9x&amp;rsquo;s fantastic tutorials&lt;/a> when I was younger, but my only real attempt to build something complex in either language was a sudoku solver which never worked because my code for drawing the board kept segfaulting. However, I still really like and appreciate Rust. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t a developer with a particular care for memory safety, I want to try and convince you that Rust is still worth it and a great language to learn. There may sometimes be gaps between the part of the article where code is shown and where it&amp;rsquo;s explained. This article is also very code heavy, so be ready.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://emmalexandria.github.io/hugo-blog/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emmalexandria.github.io/hugo-blog/archives/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
